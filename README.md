# MineTrainRebirth

## :monorail: Introduction

### What is MineTrain?

MineTrain is a spigot plugin who allows you to create **public transit network**. It's easy and fast to create a public transit system with lines and stations which are interconnected **using no redstone**. Moreover, it analyze your player's travel data to improve your player experience (like the next stop announcement).

### Is it a *TrainCarts* replacement?

Yes and... No. *TrainCarts* is a really nice plugin (the best minecart management plugin) but is it complex and tedious to make things that are easy like a Subway system. Also, **MineTrain is sign-free and redstone-free with a user-friendly step-by-step editor** making it accessible to all. But if you want to make a complex transit system, TrainCarts will be probably better for you. :wink:

### Can I create Light Rail/Tramway line?

Yes! That's why MineTrain lightness is great, you can create light rail (tramway) or suspended metro line and station without awfully redstone circuits!
